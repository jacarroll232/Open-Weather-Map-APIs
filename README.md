Python utilizing APIs

I visualized the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. Utilizing the data from the API from Open Weather Map, i built scatter plots representing the information.

In the second jupyter notebook, I used the Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city. I then plotted the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country.
