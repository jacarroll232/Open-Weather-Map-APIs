Open Weather Map API




I created a visualization from the weather data, of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. Utilizing the data from the API from Open Weather Map, i built scatter plots representing the information. As a result, I was able to gain a better insight into the weather patterns as they relate to the equator.  As expected, the temperature increases the closer you are to the equator. 



In the second jupyter notebook, I used the Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city. I then plotted the hotels on top of a humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country.
